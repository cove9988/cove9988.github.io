As an Experienced Data Engineer with over 20 years of expertise, I have successfully navigated the realms of data modelling, engineering, and database management. My skills extend to various databases, including Postgres, Greenplum, Sybase, and MS SQL, as well as big data technologies like Spark and Zeppelin. Throughout my career, I’ve demonstrated the ability to translate business requirements into precise technical specifications, leading project teams to successful outcomes. My track record includes implementing data solutions, automating CI/CD pipelines, and consistently improving code quality within high-performance data engineering teams.

**Python Proficiency:**
More than 6 years of Python working experience, my expertise lies in developing robust solutions, capturing data, and integrating systems. I’ve applied my skills through hands-on work with OpenAI gym and stable baseline3 to build [tradinggym](https://github.com/cove9988/TradingGym)

**Large Language Model (LLM):** 
My passion for technology extends beyond data engineering. I’ve actively contributed to the [dbgpt project](https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT) (text2SQL), leveraging LLM capabilities to enhance text understanding and translate into SQL.

**Analytical Skills and Achievements:**
My data-driven analytical skills, combined with a can-do attitude, enable me to tackle complex technical requirements. Whether its business process modelling or mapping, I thrive on translating abstract concepts into clear technical specifications. My attention to detail and analytical troubleshooting abilities ensure that I address any issues that may arise during project execution.
