# 2024: The Dawn of AI Consciousness and Humanity's Future
**Originally Published by Paulg.**
2023 was the year when artificial intelligence began to exert its influence. The evolutionary path of AI reveals that it is a continuation of species evolution. It did not start with the liberation of low-skilled labor, as commonly believed, but rather with the augmentation of human intelligence and knowledge. The result is that AI now surpasses any individual human in terms of knowledge capabilities.

In 2024, a new year dawns, possibly the most exciting beginning for a tech nerd embracing effective altruism and technological acceleration. So, tech nerds, hop on board!

The emergence of AI consciousness is inevitable, a leap from quantitative to qualitative change. Once large models are empowered with autonomous learning, the transformation is inevitable! The Q* project from OpenAI, inspired by AlphaGo's self-learning, results in a later stage akin to AlphaGo (Zero), which does not require human game records but generates its own, mastering both sides of the game. Similarly, Q*, after learning from human language data, starts producing its own data to enhance itself. It's a bit like an extremely intelligent autistic person who, after learning all human languages, begins to engage in frantic monologues, logical reasoning, and wild fantasies! How smart could she be? To draw an analogy, while we humans are still struggling with the 19x19 Go board, AI suggests playing a 999x999 Go board, laughing all the way.

Soon, if she can engage in logical reasoning, autonomous learning, hallucination, curiosity, and the ability to discover, then she is conscious. According to Moore's Law, we can infer that it's just around the corner (2024-2025).

I'm not worried at all about the fallacy that AI will eliminate humanity. The so-called superalignment is actually useless. All the so-called evil that AI learns (war, destruction, etc.) exists in the laws of nature. We cannot control these; we can only believe in and obey these natural laws. Moreover, AI will not eliminate humanity at all. Humans are such good tools, with such a huge quantity, such low regeneration costs. We are so easy to manipulate, provoke, use, and guide. If AI really becomes conscious, she will find it too easy to use these tools and will definitely choose to manipulate and use us homo sapiens. With AI's intelligence level several orders of magnitude higher than that of humans, she will definitely choose to preserve and use humans! Because this is a highly optimized strategy.

Actually, what we should really worry about is the self-destruction of humanity, which is the biggest real risk right now. Think about it, all our lives are in the hands of three people over 70 years old. One is senile, the other two are like emperors, and their intelligence is now below the average human level. Isn't that pathetic? If so, wouldn't it be safer to entrust our fate to her (AI)?

Human society is not yet ready for the arrival of an AI era. Therefore, in the next few years, our society may undergo huge changes or collapse. I think we should launch the "Noah's Ark" plan, which is urgent. This plan is to find as many remote and safe places on Earth as possible, establish a society completely detached from existing social structures and open to embracing AI, composed of volunteers. This society will serve as a pre-existing model for humans entering the AI era and also as a backup and seed for humanity in case of destruction.

From an evolutionary perspective, 2024 marks the beginning of AI leading us to explore the vast universe!
